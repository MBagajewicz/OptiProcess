    # independent tolerance for the inner mass-balance fixed point: everything
    # below is expressed as a MULTIPLE of `iteration_tolerance` (times the total
    # feed flow, since the inner error is absolute on flows [mol/s]).
    #   FLOOR_FACTOR : tightest inner tolerance, as a multiple of
    #                  iteration_tolerance. < 1 so the inner solve stays inside
    #                  the outer criterion instead of exactly on it.
    #   RELAX_FACTOR : how much LOOSER than iteration_tolerance the inner solve
    #                  may be while the outer error is still large.
    #   FRACTION     : inner tolerance as a fraction of the current outer error.
    # Set INNER_TOL_RELAX_FACTOR = INNER_TOL_FLOOR_FACTOR to disable the
    # relaxation and always solve the inner fixed point to the tight tolerance.
    # Declare a candidate pressure-infeasible as soon as the outer loop runs out
    # of iterations with the pressure clamp active, WITHOUT trying the remaining
    # solvers.
    #
    # DISABLED because it is unsound, and demonstrably so. Non-convergence of one
    # solver is not a property of the candidate. Measured counter-example
    # (Scenario_S1, L=0.6, D=0.17, d_fo/t = 1.3e-4/5e-5, i.e. a 30 um bore,
    # eps=0.42, PI): the LU rung exhausts its iterations with the clamp active and
    # the shortcut rejected it as pressure-infeasible after a single rung -- yet
    # the MARCHING solver converges the same candidate in 10.7 s. The verdict was
    # a property of the solver, not of the design.
    #
    # With it off, such candidates run the full ladder and, if nothing resolves
    # them, are reported as UNRESOLVED (time budget) and logged -- honest, and

        So the inlet and the outlet are probed first. Those are the extremes of
        both the composition path (the retentate is progressively stripped of the
        fast species) and the pressure profile, and in practice the outlet is the
        binding node. If either fails, the answer is already exact and the
        remaining nodes are never touched. Only candidates that survive the probe
        pay for the full sweep -- and in Smart Enumeration those are precisely the
        ones that go on to update the incumbent, which is where exactness matters.

        No interpolation, no extrapolation, no assumed monotonicity of T_dew
        along the module: T_dew is a nonlinear functional of the whole
        composition vector, and the majority species is not itself monotone.
